    <synopsis>Centuries ago, mankind was slaughtered to near extinction by monstrous humanoid creatures called titans, forcing humans to hide in fear behind enormous concentric walls. What makes these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures, Eren Yeager dedicates his life to their eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats the merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls. Based on Hajime Isayama&amp;#039;s award-winning manga, [i]Shingeki no Kyojin[/i] follows Eren, along with his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman and his childhood friend Armin Arlert, as they join the brutal war against the titans and race to discover a way of defeating them before the last walls are breached.&lt;br /&gt;

    <synopsis>Many years before becoming the famed captain of the Survey Corps, a young Levi struggles to survive in the capital&amp;#039;s garbage dump, the Underground. As the boss of his own criminal operation, Levi attempts to get by with meager earnings while aided by fellow criminals, Isabel Magnolia and Farlan Church. With little hope for the future, Levi accepts a deal from the anti-expedition faction leader Nicholas Lobov, who promises the trio citizenship aboveground if they are able to successfully assassinate Erwin Smith, a squad leader of the Survey Corps.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As Levi and Erwin cross paths, Erwin acknowledges Levi&amp;#039;s agility and skill and gives him the option to either become part of the expedition team, or be turned over to the Military Police, to atone for his crimes. Now closer to the man they are tasked to kill, the group plans to complete their mission and save themselves from a grim demise in the dim recesses of their past home. However, they are about to learn that the surface world is not as liberating as they had thought and that sometimes, freedom can come at a heavy price.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Based on the popular spin-off manga of the same name, [i]Shingeki no Kyojin: Kuinaki Sentaku[/i] illustrates the encounter between two of [i]Shingeki no Kyojin[/i]&amp;#039;s pivotal characters, as well as the events of the 23rd expedition beyond the walls.&lt;br /&gt;
